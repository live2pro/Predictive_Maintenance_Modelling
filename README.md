# Predictive Maintenance Modelling Demo (Python)

This project is demonstration of a real-time predictive maintenance model application. The project is comprised of the following three parts:

+ A Python implementation of [this](https://gallery.azure.ai/Notebook/Predictive-Maintenance-Implementation-Guide-R-Notebook-2) popular R notebook that contains the steps of implementing a predictive maintenance model: [Link](https://github.com/transferlearnings/Predictive_Maintenance_Modelling/blob/master/notebooks/Predictive%20Maintenance%20Modelling%20Guide.ipynb)

+ A Python application to simulate a real time feed of simulated failure, maintainence and condition data. This application will:
  +

+ A set of Google Cloud Function to perform feature engineering and predictions on the data stream

+ A job to train
